Summary Programming for AI - 2:

Students were satisfied about both the course and lecturer. The course in general is seen as having a good pace, appropriate difficulty curve and good structure. The lecturer is seen as approachable, a good explainer and strong at keeping lectures interesting. 

There were some comments on the course missing literature apart from the slides, whether it would be used for further deepening by motivated students or as elaboration on topics discussed in lectures. 

On the topic of TA's there were frequent remarks on a variance in grading schemes and conflicting pieces of advice on student's questions during practicals, combined with remarks of grading being late (even passed the deadline of the assignment's redo). Other than that TA's were evaluated positively, with the ever present request for more of them.

The exam was graded fairly well, although relatively many commented on the size of answer boxes being too small and prefering a digital version. 

The DPC advices to keep the core of the course as it is, but spend time on making a comprehensive universal grading scheme for TA's if not already present, pursue options for digital examination, and look for a viable way to grant willing students with literature apart from slides being put online. The course has been graded with an average of 7.9, the lecturer with a 8.2.
