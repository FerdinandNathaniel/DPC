DPC - AI:A 

total grade: 7.3
teacher grade: 7.5
exam grade: 7.5

Content course:
- clear and comprehensive.
- gives a good overview of AI
- lectures by various professors seen as big plus

Improvements:
- Updating slides and making these more uniform for the course (advisable to use a template and translate current slides into them with minor revisions)
- More clarity on the coherence Between lectures/subjects (clarity per subject already quite well received)
- Some talk about pace, where the start is seen as too easy compared to the later assignments
- Feedback on assignments

Summary:
The general opinion of students on the course's content was it being clear and comprehensive within the confines of the lecture, but lacking in coherence between lectures. Comments were made about the structure of slides variating vastly between lecturers and needing an update. The course was evaluated as being a good introduction to AI, where the presence of multiple lecturers was seen as a plus. 

Most critique was on the topic of feedback on assignments. Many students remarked a missing of accurate feedback to know whether what they handed in was good or not, as the binary grading of sufficient/insufficient did not convey this very well.

The DPC advises to continue as is regarding the lectures, only updating the slides and making them more uniform between lecturers (e.g. by using a basic template). On the topic of TA's the DPC advises to increase the amount of feedback students get on their assignments, optionally making minor changes to the grading to more accurately reflect a student's quality of work. Overal the course was graded with a 7.3 and the teachers with a 7.5.

DPC - Academic Skills 1 

total grade: 6.8
teacher grade: 8.4
exam grade: -

Positives:
- Great lectures
- Continual improvement and evaluation
- Mentor meetings seen as a great plus
- Freedom (regarding subject choice)
- Strong principal core
- Learning to present yourself

Improvements:
- Problems cited regarding the initial set-up for the course and the continual improvements generating lots of unclarity and confusion. 
    - Being overwhelmed on BlackBoard with frequency of posts
- Grading system perceived as incomprehensive
    - Peer grading invites unfair variance for the grading between groups, complete with ambiguity about what behaviour constitutes what grade (with quite some referencing the 0-3 scale as not preferable)
- Not enough practically grounded information on writing, many reply not feeling like their actual writing skills had improved.

Summary:
Students were very positive on the lectures and the lecturer, experiencing them as fun and interesting. Students were positive on the freedom gotten regarding choice of subject, learning how to present yourself in a general manner, and the principal core of the course. They saw room for improvement on the structure of the course, referencing a chaotic nature of information provision, ambiguous grading schemes, and a theoretical grounding of learning how to write in practise.

On the topic of information provisions remarks were made on an extensive use of BlackBoard messaging that sometimes had an adverse effect on clarity, as one student remarked it as '[..] wading through weed to find the information you needed'.

On the topic of grading there were many who expressed concern on the variance peer-reviewing gives, as one group might interpret the grading scheme differently (or more favorably to friends) than others. Added to this was a general confusion on what the terms of grading and the grading scale (0-3) meant, and that the feedback although welcome lacked authority as there were no clearly perceived guidelines on what was good or bad.

The DPC advices to keep going strong on the core of the course, adjusting merely for a more practically grounded approach to teaching how to write, giving more guidance on what is good and bad in writing. Furthermore we advice a critical look at the grading scheme for clarity at the level of a novice and on how to lessen the variance in grading between groups. The lecturer has been evaluated well with a 8.5, the course itself with a 6.8.

DPC - Programming for AI 1

total grade: 8.1
teacher grade: 8.4
exam grade: 8.0

Positives:
- Great positive lectures, easy to understand and good examples
- Fair exam

Neutral:
- Those with previous programming experience found the course rather easy, whilst those with none found the pace sometimes a bit too high

Improvements:
- Variance in quality of TA's high
- Coherence between TA's regarding grading and answering questions during practicals.
- Lack of TA's
- Doing exam on computer would be preferable

Summary:
Students were very much satisfied with both the lecturer and the course. The lectures were seen as insightful, fun and easy to understand. The exam was reviewed as fair and adequate, though preference was stated for a digital version. 

On the topic of TA's there were many remarks on the variance in grading. Students had trouble following advice of TA's at practicals, as they were perceived to give different answers to the same question, and due to the apparent variance in grading methods between TA's the students were unsure what advice to follow. 

The DPC advices to take a good look at TA grading and create a comprehensive universal grading scheme if not already present to reduce the variance in grading between TA's. Opportunities for digital examination should also be taken a good look at. Other than that, the course has been evaluated positively with a 8.1, the lecturer with a 8.4 and the exam with a 8.0.

DPC - Brain Computer Interfacing 

total grade: 8.0
teacher grade: 9.5
exam grade: 7.3

Positives:
- Great lecturer and subsequently great lectures
- practicals seen as interesting and very coherently linked to the theoretical side of the course

Improvements:
- Don't put a deadline right after the holidays
- Create an individual component in the grading of the group project
- Students found it difficult to know what to expect on the exam
- Some kind of literature or lecture notes was seen as a welcome addition for when lectures were missed due to unforeseen circumstances and slides themselves missed explanations. 

Summary:
Students were incredibly positive about the lectures and the lecturer. The practicals were seen as interesting and coherently linked to the theoretical aspect of the course. 

Some comments were made on a deadline of a group report that was put right after the holidays, hindering the ability of the group to work together due to absenses and making it harder to ask for help when stuck. The exam too had some remarks, mostly on a difficulty of what to expect. On the topic of grading some missed the individual aspect within the grading of a group assignment, saying that a significantly unequal distribution of workload amongst group members in the end still gives everyone an equal evaluation. Lastly there was a remark on the ambiguity of slides when not being able to be present at the lecture, and the absense of any course literature or a book to find missed content in.

The DPC advices to stay course regarding the lectures and practicals, whilst reviewing the grading scheme for groups to protect against freeloaders. Some kind of course literature or recordings of the lecture to point at when missing a lecture due to unforeseen circumstances should also be looked at. Furthermore would it be advisable to not put a deadline for a group project immediately after the Christmas holidays. This all with the following evaluations: the course has been evaluated with a 8.0, the lecturer with a 9.5 and the exam with a 7.3.
