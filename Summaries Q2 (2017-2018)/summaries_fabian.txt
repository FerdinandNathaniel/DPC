DPC - AI:A 

Summary:
The general opinion of students on the course's content was it being clear and comprehensive within the confines of the lecture, but lacking in coherence between lectures. Comments were made about the structure of slides variating vastly between lecturers and needing an update. The course was evaluated as being a good introduction to AI, where the presence of multiple lecturers was seen as a plus. 

Most critique was on the topic of feedback on assignments. Many students remarked a missing of accurate feedback to know whether what they handed in was good or not, as the binary grading of sufficient/insufficient did not convey this very well.

The DPC advises to continue as is regarding the lectures, only updating the slides and making them more uniform between lecturers (e.g. by using a basic template). On the topic of TA's the DPC advises to increase the amount of feedback students get on their assignments, optionally making minor changes to the grading to more accurately reflect a student's quality of work. Overal the course was graded with a 7.3 and the teachers with a 7.5.

DPC - Academic Skills 1 

Summary:
Students were very positive on the lectures and the lecturer, experiencing them as fun and interesting. Students were positive on the freedom gotten regarding choice of subject, learning how to present yourself in a general manner, and the principal core of the course. They saw room for improvement on the structure of the course, referencing a chaotic nature of information provision, ambiguous grading schemes, and lacking a theoretical grounding of learning how to write in practise.

On the topic of information provisions remarks were made on an extensive use of BlackBoard messaging that sometimes had an adverse effect on clarity, as one student remarked it as '[..] wading through weed to find the information you needed'.

On the topic of grading there were many who expressed concern on the variance peer-reviewing gives, as one group might interpret the grading scheme differently (or more favorably to friends) than others. Added to this was a general confusion on what the terms of grading and the grading scale (0-3) meant, and that the feedback although welcome lacked authority as there were no clearly perceived guidelines on what was good or bad.

The DPC advices to keep going strong on the core of the course, adjusting merely for a more practically grounded approach to teaching how to write, giving more guidance on what is good and bad in writing. Furthermore we advice a critical look at the grading scheme for clarity at the level of a novice and on how to lessen the variance in grading between groups. The lecturer has been evaluated well with a 8.5, the course itself with a 6.8.

DPC - Programming for AI 1

Summary:
Students were very much satisfied with both the lecturer and the course. The lectures were seen as insightful, fun and easy to understand. The exam was reviewed as fair and adequate, though preference was stated for a digital version. 

On the topic of TA's there were many remarks on the variance in grading. Students had trouble following advice of TA's at practicals, as they were perceived to give different answers to the same question, and due to the apparent variance in grading methods between TA's the students were unsure what advice to follow. 

The DPC advices to take a good look at TA grading and create a comprehensive universal grading scheme if not already present to reduce the variance in grading between TA's. Opportunities for digital examination should also be taken a good look at. Other than that, the course has been evaluated positively with a 8.1, the lecturer with a 8.4 and the exam with a 8.0.

DPC - Brain Computer Interfacing 

Summary:
Students were incredibly positive about the lectures and the lecturer. The practicals were seen as interesting and coherently linked to the theoretical aspect of the course. 

Some comments were made on a deadline of a group report that was put right after the holidays, hindering the ability of the group to work together due to absenses and making it harder to ask for help when stuck. The exam too had some remarks, mostly on a difficulty of what to expect. On the topic of grading some missed the individual aspect within the grading of a group assignment, saying that a significantly unequal distribution of workload amongst group members in the end still gives everyone an equal evaluation. Lastly there was a remark on the ambiguity of slides when not being able to be present at the lecture, and the absense of any course literature or a book to find missed content in.

The DPC advices to stay course regarding the lectures and practicals, whilst reviewing the grading scheme for groups to protect against freeloaders. Some kind of course literature or recordings of the lecture to point at when missing a lecture due to unforeseen circumstances should also be looked at. Furthermore it would be advisable to not put a deadline for a group project immediately after the Christmas holidays. This all with the following evaluations: the course has been evaluated with a 8.0, the lecturer with a 9.5 and the exam with a 7.3.
