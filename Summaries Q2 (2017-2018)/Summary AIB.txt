The general opinion about both the course and the lecturer are bad. Problems with the course are wide-ranging, and too far-reaching to accurately yet also concisely compose within this document. It's heavily advised to read through the course evaluations thoroughly and extensively to read upon the background of all that's listed below. Let the number of issues raised not diminish the importance of each individual one.

Students felt thrown into the deep with regard to Python, not having any introductory to the language nor was the manual seen as sufficient or of quality. Code given to students was seen as bulky, complex, and too hard to understand without given an introduction into the workings of the undocumented code. Grading was seen as strict, with comments pointing at the difference of quality in code they were expected to write and document, and code they were given that did not work and was undocumented. 

The practicals were seen as not worthwhile, with rooms where TA's were present being overcrowded, as their help was mandatory for succeeding. Students remarked both a lack of TA's as of a big variance in quality between TA's, going to the point of consistently naming 'the good and the bad' on various occasions. TA's were also given non-functioning answer models.

Students missed a teacher's presence in the course, and also remarked on an unprofessional means of communication from the teacher both on BlackBoard as via email. Also a feeling was present that the teacher does not take responsibility for the course.

The basic premise of the course; a contest between students on programming Pacman agents, is seen still as a positive. This is yet overshadowed by the feeling of many that they did not learn anything from the course they followed. 

The DPC advices strongly an extensive revision of the course, organisation of TA's, and personal rule of conduct. The course has been graded with a 5.1. The lecturer has been graded with a 5.
