### Meetings

- **General DPC meeting**

    This is the 4-weekly meeting with all members of the DPC, this currently includes: 
    - student members (3)
    - staff members (3)
    - advisory members (Nav, chair of education CognAC, international first year student)
    - secretary (Lieve)

- **Student DPC meeting**

    This is an optional (and advisable) meeting the students of the DPC can organise themselves. Doing this 4-weekly, off-setting the general DPC meeting by 2 weeks, can help in streamlining tasks that need to be done and solving any upcoming crises.
